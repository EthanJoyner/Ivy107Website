            <p>I diverse myself in the activities and projects I take part of. However, I often find thats is hard to put what I can do on a resume...  <br>
                 So I built a website.</p>

                        <p>Applying the programming skills I learn to something tangible is key for me. Otherwise, I  will dismiss it; just as we all dismissed indigenous rocks in elelmentary school (No offense to archeologists). I primarily program in <b>Python</b>, <b>Java</b>, and soon, <b>C</b>. </p>

                            <h3>Leadership</h3>
                        </header>
                        <p>To lead for control is not my philosophy. To be a leader is to actively distinguish yourself to show you are willing to go the extra mile for the team. Whether Iâ€™m leading a <b>social justice</b> event or a <b>lab project</b>, I make sure that quality is implemented throughout every task at hand.</p>

                        </header>
                        <p>For me, engineering is to design art with more than a visual appeal, engineering takes an issue at face value, and solves it while maintaining stylistic aesthetic and mechanical functionality. I model my designs in <b>Solidworks</b>.
