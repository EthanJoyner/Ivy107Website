                    <p> It's just me, my little corner of the world (which also happens to be the internet at this point). If for some reason, you came across this website not knowing who I am, my name is Ethan Joyner. Born and raised in Baltimore, I am currently 20, and I am a college sophomore. I attend Morgan State University, and my major is computer engineering.</p>
                    <p>A funny thing, making a website is tedious, but creating content is the most challenging part of the site, because it's a portrayal of myself. I am grounded in who I am, but it's weird when social media constantly makes you consolidate your thoughts and ideas into a single paragraph, but now I have an entire platform to express and broadcast myself. Where to start?</p>

                    <p>As a kid, the idea of building something has always intrigued me. So I joined the Lego club in 4th grade. I made whatever I wanted and loved it. As time went on, I was introduced to Lego Mindstorms, a creative robotics kit for early exposure to engineering. I found strong suits in building robots, and I carried my skills to high school. But of course, similar to my elementary/middle school years, I found a way to surround myself in similar creative minds as we sketched ideas, programmed, and built robots. </p>
                    <p>I was fortunate enough to have plenty of lucky breaks in my life, which is a privilege amongst itself. From writing code that works on the first time, to getting access to software and hardware that I never thought I could own. Though I can't share any of those things, the least I can do is share my knowledge and insight as to how I go about my design process. Though I am still learning my self, I may have the advantage in making and sharing the real rookie mistakes I made in my projects; sharing the how-not-to's and, of course, the alternatives.</p>

                        <p>I’m looking forward to what I can do with this website. I’m not going to only show the best parts of me, that would be fake. I make as many errors and mess ups as the next person. I'm going to end up putting things that are wrong on here, but eventually I plan to learn how to do things right. Wish me luck!
