                        <p>Every project has a story behind it. And often time those stories have lessons behind them. When I have an idea for a product, it always stems from some issue or problem I encounter. Instead of saying, “I wish there were a tool to help me…” I say: </p>

                        <h4>“I’m going to <b>make</b> a tool to help me…” <br> and then I get to work.</h4>

                        <p>First, it all gets laid out on paper. Then I take to CAD modeling and rapid prototyping (RP). After several trials of mechanical faults, programming errors, and making the aesthetic just a little more appealing, then and only then can it start to resemble a finished product. I don’t believe products and projects can ever genuinely be complete because they can always be made better; there can still be upgrades. Maybe I can add a cup holder to it. Who knows?
